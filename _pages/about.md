I am a Research Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://wp.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Department of Physics</a> at the <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>

I am an observational astronomer. I use large telescopes like the <a href="https://www.keck.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">Keck Observatory</a>, the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/home" target="_blank">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, and the <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/home" target="_blank">James Webb Space Telescope</a> to study astrophysics of the cosmic baryon cycle. See my [Research](/al-folio/research/) and the list of [Publications](/al-folio/publications/) for more details.

I maintain several tools for data reduction and analyses in astronomy. Check out my software page for more details.
							
I was born in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shijiazhuang,+Hebei,+China/@38.0437953,114.2241376,10z" target="_blank">Shijiazhuang, China</a>, became an amateur astronomer in high school, got my B.S. in Astronomy at <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn//" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, and M.S. and Ph.D. in Astrophysics at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Caltech</a>. In Chinese characters, my name stands for sunshine (昱; yù), and light (光; guāng). Here is [my CV](/al-folio/cv/).

Grown up as an amateur astronomer, I care deeply about the outreach of astronomy to the general public. Here is my [outreach projects](/al-folio/outreach/)
