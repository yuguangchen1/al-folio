For integral field units, converting data from observations to well calibrated data cubes is a complex task. I am leading or significantly contributing to many data reduction pipelines particularly for the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). 

For more information, please check out the [KCWIKit webpage](https://github.com/yuguangchen1/KcwiKit), the [KCWI DRP webpage](https://kcwi-drp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
