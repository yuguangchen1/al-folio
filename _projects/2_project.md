Lyα emission is a powerful tool for investigating ionizing photon escape and star formation activity in early galaxies. Using a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data, the KBSS-KCWI survey explore how Lyα velocity profiles, equivalent widths, etc. correlate with ionizing escape fractions and other important properties for early galaxies. These efforts aim to refine models of reionization and improve the accuracy of metallicity diagnostics across cosmic time.

The KBSS-KCWI survey has obtained the largest and deepest integral field units data on $$>120$$ star-forming galaxies at $$z = 2-3$$. The complete dataset has a limiting surface brightness of $$10^{-20} erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2\$$, and covers a variety of star-forming galaxies. 

A (hopefully) complete list of publications are shown below.
